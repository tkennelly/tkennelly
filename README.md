## [OC Tracker](https://github.com/tkennelly/OC_Tracker)

This OC Tracker showcases the full stack development skills I have gained through the first half of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. This program is intended to help Writers, TTRPG Players, and anyone with creative minds not only keep track of their Original Characters, but also catagorize them by their home worlds.

Players will earn points based on Edwin's perception of their answers and by the end of their interaction, they will know if they are able to score a date with him!
